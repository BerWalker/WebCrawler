# WebCrawler
This WebCrawler, developed as a bonus module for the Solyd course, scrapes car ads from the Django An√∫ncios website. It collects ad links, extracts phone numbers using regex, and saves them to a CSV file. The process is optimized with threading to perform multiple requests in parallel for faster results.
